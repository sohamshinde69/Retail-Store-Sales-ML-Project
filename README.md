# Retail-Store-Sales-ML-Project

This project focuses on cleaning, preprocessing, and modeling a real-world retail dataset containing 12,575 transactions. A significant portion of the data (~4,000 rows) had missing values in the Discount Applied column.

Rather than filling missing values using simple methods like mean/median/mode, this project uses machine learning to predict missing discounts based on item categories, prices, quantities, and more.
